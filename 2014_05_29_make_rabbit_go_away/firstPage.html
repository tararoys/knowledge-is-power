  <p>Knoweldge is power. Let me give you some knowledge of computers.</p>
  <p> Let us use that power to make this rabbit go away. </p>

<p>Put your mouse the picture of the rabbit and push the right mouse button. You will see a list. Go to Inpsect Element. </p>
<img src="./firstPage_files/inspect_element.gif">
<p>These are the developer tools.In the left section you will see a bit of writing that is colored blue. This bit of writing is the rabbit.  It is the rabbit because when you pushed "Inspect Element," you said to the computer, "I want to see the bit of writing that made this be on this page." </p>
<p> Now we will make the rabbit go away. </p>
<img src="./firstPage_files/make_element_go_away.gif">
<p>Make sure the bit of writing that is the picture of the rabbit is colored blue.  Then go to the style window in the upper right of the Developer Tools. Double click in the style window. Write display. Press the tab key. Write none. As you do, the rabbit will go away!</p>
<p> Notice that the bit of writing is still there.  We did not make the rabbit go away...it is still there. What we did is tell the rabbit to not be seen. It is still there.  But we are not able to see it. </p>
