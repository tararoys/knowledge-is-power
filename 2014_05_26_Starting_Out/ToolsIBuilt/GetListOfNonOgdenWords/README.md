  This machine lets you make the discovery of what words in a bit of writing are not Ogden's Basic English.  You put in a bit of writing, and give the space key a push, and in place of these words a there will be list of all of the words in that bit of writing that are not in Ogden's Basic English.

This bit of writing is very much a bad bit of work.  I had the desire for a thing to be done more quick, because I had a bit of writing that was in Ogden's Basic English, but had 30 words that were not in Ogden's Basic English.  I was making the attempt to put all of them in a list, but because there were 30 I was not getting all of them.

I now am not certain that I need this machine, because if there are more than 30 words in a bit of writing that are not Basic English, that is a sign that there are more new ideas than I have the desire to have in a bit of writing. So I may not need this again, but if I do, it is there. 

It works like this: 

1. put a bit of writing in the box and push down on the space key one time.  
2. A list of the words that are not in Ogden's Basic english will be on top of the box. 

The list of words will be in the order in which they first are seen in the bit of writing.
