English is a language, is like making signs with your hands to say an idea to a person, 

To keep things simple, I am only going to use a small part of English.

There was a man named Ogden who made the discovery that he was able to say almost 
anything if he used only 850 words.  He gave these 850 words the name Ogden's Basic English. 

I am going to use only those words.  

It turns out that there are a great number more words on the list than the 850 words Ogden gives.

This is because each word has a great number of forms.  For example, the word 'do' has the forms

do, does, doing, did 

and the word yellow has the forms 

yellows, yellowed, yellower, yellowest, yellowing

and some more.  

It was very hard to use only those words, because I did not have a good idea of what words I 
was able to let myself use.  

So I made lists of all of the words I was able to let myself use.  These lists are here.  

These lists have a great number of errors that I have not fixed.  They are very much a thing that I am still working on.
