Syntax Highlighter,is an apparatus that makes certain words a different colour so you are able to see them better, is like a light that lets you see important parts,OgdenSyntaxHighlighter/syntaxHiglighterIsLikeALight.gif   

This is the most important part that lets me only use 850 words.  It is the most important part of a system that lets me see if I am using the right words. When I use words that are in my list, the words turn brown and I am certain that I may let myself use them.  When I use words that are not on my list, the words are black and I am certain that they are a new bit of knowledge.  

This lets me see what things I have knowledge of, and what things I need to be learning.
